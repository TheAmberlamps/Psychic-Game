# Psychic-Game

A "simple" javascript game, written by yours truly.

This project was in some ways harder than I was imagining, but in others far simpler. Funnily enough one of the most difficult things for me to code was appending guesses.

It's a good thing that I re-read the homework instructions, or I wouldn't have linked to my game through my Portfolio.
